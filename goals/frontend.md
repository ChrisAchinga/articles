To be honest, I have had a pretty rough road here. I was jumping from one css framework to another without grasping and practising the basics of css. I lost count of how many times I failed in creating designs, leave alone simple styling html components.

All in all I have had my good time and why not document it.

Frontend development is basically creating the user interface and experience for a website or an application for an end-user to interact with.

There are alot of tools and languages involved in this peice of cake, but the secret to all of this is simply to master the basics, nothin much.

HTML, CSS and JS are the core languages and tools here. So here's what I have to say on Front End Development:

## Basics

For one to have a strong foundation on frontend development, here is a check list:

- learn to work with the DOM
- simpe web page building blocks with HTML 5
- animations and transitions with vanila css
- practice vanila css alongside html
- try designing responsive layouts
- create accessible sites
- hosting static sites

these are just basic challenges I think you should practise with frequently to get your grip in the stack.
