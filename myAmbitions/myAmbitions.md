It is impossibe to know everything from A to Z but knowing the basics doesn't kill. Well not just knowing the whats and hows, should be able to solve some problems with the tools and resources.

It's not easy to chose the right tool and technology, but this is what I do. I visit the top tech companies, event the local ones in my town and look for their job requirements and specifications.I gather the informations the group similar stuff together then try and see what's good for me or what tool I'm comfortable with.
