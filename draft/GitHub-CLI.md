### Pilot

[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) beta version was released a while ago, and it comes with really cool features. I have been using and interacting with github without necessarily visiting the webiste, that's fun right.

An alternative to using [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is [HUB](https://hub.github.com/), which was there before github cli was introduced.

[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is an open source project, here on [GitHub](https://github.com/cli/cli/)

I had an article before on using [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and its commands, so this is kind of like an update because the cli is up on version 1.x.x right now, better to stay on the know/updated. To get latest releases of the cli https://github.com/cli/cli/releases

Everything you need to know about the cli is on their site, https://cli.github.com/

## Installation

[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) has to be installed on your device for you to use it.

## Usage

With the cli, you can create repos, pull requests, issues, clone repos and much more.

> If i were to write on every usage gh cli has to offer, this would have been one of the longest and probably most boring technical article, so i'll break them down and make a mini-article-series, if that makes sense.

## `gh repo clone`

This is one of the commands github cli comes with. The gh clone works in a similar way as the popular git command, git clone.

Note that git and github cli are two different things, but the gh clone and git clone perform a similar function altogether, and have a similar syntax.

to use the command, browse into your favorite github project and clone it using github cli, easy and fun.

For me, I'll go to one of my repos, https://github.com/ChrisAchinga/javascript.
click on the green button code, a dropdown appears, click on the Github CLI tab and copy the command;

![gh repo clone](../static-files/ghclirepoclone.png)

`gh repo clone ChrisAchinga/javascript`

Simple as that and you are done.

A simple start into becoming a github cli master!
