# The GitHub CLI

>GitHub on Your Terminal

Github cli version was released a while ago, and it comes with really cool features. I have been using and interacting with github without necessarily visiting the webiste, that's fun right.

An alternative to using github cli is hub https://hub.github.com/, which was there before github cli was introduced.

it is an open source project, here on github: https://cli.github.com/

I had an article before on using github cli and its commands, so this is kind of like an update because the cli is up on version 1.x.x right now, better to stay on the know/updated. To get latest releases of the cli https://github.com/cli/cli/releases

everything you need to know about the cli is on their site, https://cli.github.com/.

## installation

github cli has to be installed on your device for you to use it.
view installation procedures based on your operating system: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation

## usage

with the cli, you can create repos, pull requests, issues, clone repos and much more.
 
if i were to write on every usage gh cli has to offer, this would have been one of the longest and probably most boring technical article, so i'll break them down and make a mini-article-series, if that makes sense.
