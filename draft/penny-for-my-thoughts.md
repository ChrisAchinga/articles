# Penny For My Thoughts

>Warning: Non-Child Friendly Language/Terms Used.

I decided to take some time off technical thinking and be normal. 

Lots of shit happening around the world right now, so it's kinda hard to maintain a clean and healthy mind without struggling with evil thoughts and ideas. It is acceptable to be having breakdowns from time to time because I think it's healthy, anyway life ain't easy, but it doesn't mean that I or you should go through hell.
