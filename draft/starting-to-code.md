# Ready Set, Wait... Go

>Okay funny tittle but we all know how hard it is to giving names, especialy when it comes to variables. 

But it is easy to start programming with little or null knowledge at all. Let's get started.

## Pilot

The easiest way to becoming a programmer is by doing what I did. It was a simple html page that printed the obvious "Hello Word!". Sure you could do that in many other languages. But this article will help you make the first step into programming by coding a simple and basic website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting a text editor
A text editor is the software or application where you will create and edit your code. A document of course. There are alot of text editors available, Google comes in handy but here is a list of a few of my favorites:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
3. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
   
My personal favorite is VSCode, but they all do the same tasks after all.

You may want to install a text editor if you don't have one.

## Creating your first file

First of all, I'll open my editor (VSCode), as shown in the image below:

![vscode window](../static-files/vsc.png)

To create a new file, use the shortcut `ctr + N` or click on `File` on the tool bar on top and select `New File`.
